# ObjectsPrinciples - Project Network Diagram

This repository contains a Mermaid diagram representing an Activity-on-Arrow (AOA) network for project management using CPM/PERT methodology.

## Files

- **MermaidDiagram.js** - The corrected AOA network diagram in Mermaid format
- **DIAGRAM_ANALYSIS.md** - Detailed analysis of errors found in the original diagram and explanations of corrections

## Diagram Overview

The diagram represents a project with 32 activities (A-Z plus α, β, γ, δ, λ, ρ) with the following characteristics:
- **52 nodes** representing project milestones/events
- **32 activities** with specified durations
- **Multiple dummy activities** (dotted lines) to properly represent complex dependencies
- Activities range from simple tasks with no dependencies to complex tasks requiring up to 5 predecessors

## How to View

The diagram uses Mermaid syntax and can be visualized using:
1. GitHub's built-in Mermaid rendering (in markdown files)
2. [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/) or [mermaid.js.org](https://mermaid.js.org/)
3. Any Mermaid-compatible viewer or IDE extension

## Diagram Structure

The diagram follows AOA (Activity-on-Arrow) network conventions:
- **Nodes (N1, N2, ...)**: Represent events or milestones
- **Solid arrows (→)**: Represent actual activities with durations in parentheses
- **Dotted arrows (⋯→)**: Represent dummy activities (no duration, used for dependency logic)

### Example Activity Sequences:
- **A, D, G, J, N, S**: One potential sequence through the network
- **C, F, I, M, P, W, β**: Another sequence with different activities

Note: These represent logical sequences of activities, not direct connections in the diagram. Dummy activities connect the nodes between these activities as needed.

## Activity Dependencies

All activity dependencies have been verified against the source table to ensure:
- Correct precedence relationships
- Proper use of merge nodes where multiple activities must complete
- Accurate representation using dummy activities where needed

## Status

✅ **VERIFIED CORRECT** - The current diagram accurately represents all activities and their dependencies as specified in the project requirements.
